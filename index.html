    â€œNestled in the rocky foothills of the snow-capped Sword Mountains is the mining town of Phandalin. 
    Crumbling stone ruins surround the new houses and ships. Phandalins residents are quiet, 
    hard-working folk who came from distant cities to eke out a life amid the harsh wilderness. 
    They are farmers, stonecutters, blacksmiths, traders, prospectors, and children. The town has 
    no walls and no garrison, but most adults keep weapons within easy reach. Visitors are more than 
    welcome, if they bring coin or news. The Townmasters hall, found in the center of town in the 
    square where the townsfolk congregate, has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell 
    tower at the back. The job board next to the front door features a sparse number of notices, all 
    written in the Common hand. Here, we find a pair of adventurers discussing the freshly penned notices."

<p class = "fifth"> This was the introduction paragraph I read to my players when starting this most recent
    D&D, or Dungenons and Dragons game, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/doip">Dragon of Icespire Peak.</a> This was the first game I have ever been able to play in-person,
    and it is frequently the best part of my week. I created this site because I am passonate about this
    hobby and love talking and writing about it.

    My current plan is to finish up this campaign by summer of 2023. After that, I plan of running a 
    game of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa">Tomb of Annihilation</a>, using the officialy published book of the same name.
